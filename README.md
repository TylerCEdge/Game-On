## About The Project

[![G A M E O N][product-screenshot]](DevReadme/FrontEnd/UI/07.01.19ui.png)

<!--!!!!!!add deployed link here!!!!!!-->

For our team project #3 we created a website that allows the user to view and search video game information, sort by recent titles that are popular as well as see upcoming titles that will be released within a given parameter.

Here's why:

<!--Put some bullet points about why we built this app, I.E. the problems we're trying to address with this app.  -->

- No wide spread resource for finding new games based on user-reported input
- Other websites push sponsered content to front page
- Popular resources often have a cluttered UI which can confuse users
- Lack of personalized content delivery for gamers
- People over-look small developer based titles from lack of exposure
